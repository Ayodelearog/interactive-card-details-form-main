## Overview
This challenge helped me practise form client-side form validation. It alerts users when they input wrong information into the input fields. I was able to dynamically display the error message as soon as users start typing. I also displayed the value of each input field in the card UI element as they were being entered in the input field.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to create dynamic UI element using the appendChild() function, and also to create forms with labels.


### Continued development

I hope to be able to clean up the CSS and make the validation better by using the small tag in my HTML.
